My website for calculating a compound interest works by taking users input and displaying the results.

If you hover over the first paragraph, it will expand, creating an exciting look. The user can enter decimal poit values, and the answer returns up to two decimals points. I did this because the answers are to be in US Dollars, adn I wanted the cents to be included as well. My website also has an image of a man growing his money tree!
